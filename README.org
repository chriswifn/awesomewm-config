#+TITLE: AwesomeWM configuration
#+AUTHOR: Christian Hageloch

* Configuration
Very basic configuration of the Awesome Window Manager.
Custom settings:
- Modus-Vivendi and Gruvbox Theme
- Custom layout text_boxes inspired by dwm
- dwm-functionality: viewing all tags on one screen at once (Mod4 + 0)
- Move clients to secondary screen while preserving window rules (certain tags for certain applications)
- Keybinding to make a client sticky (will be visible on every tag you switch to) by hitting Mod4 + Control + s
- Toggle functionality for every module in the wibar

* Installation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
