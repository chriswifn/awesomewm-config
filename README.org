#+TITLE: AwesomeWM configuration
#+AUTHOR: Christian Hageloch

This is my config for the Awesome Window Manager. This config is a lot more minimal than the default configuration.
- no window decorations
- no right click menu
- no focus follows mouse
- no wibar

* Configuration
Very basic configuration of the Awesome Window Manager.
Custom settings:
- Modus-Vivendi and Gruvbox Theme
- Keybinding to make a client sticky (will be visible on every tag you switch to) by hitting Mod4 + Control + s
- Toggle functionality for every module in the wibar

* Installation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  git clone https://github.com/chriswifn/awesomewm-config.git ~/.config/awesome
#+end_src
